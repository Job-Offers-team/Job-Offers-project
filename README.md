# Job-Offers-project
**Description** : "Job Offers" is a platform that enables clients to connect to the businesses that are suitable for them.

"Job Offers" offers the chance to explore companies and look for internships or job opportunities.

"Job Offers" has a nice-looking interface that allows clients to register in the platform. After they are registered, clients can add or edit all personal details and education details.

"Job Offers" encourages clients to add extensive details about their qualifications and experience.

Those descriptions can be more than a page long, and this is a good thing for " Job Offers" since we use the keywords in those descriptions to find a relevant student.

"job offers" also allows companies and organizations to register and fill all their respective details, edit and update those details, and set up listings for open positions they have.
